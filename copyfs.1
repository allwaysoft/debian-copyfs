.SH NAME
CopyFS \- Versioning File System for FUSE
.SH DESCRIPTION
CopyFS is a copy-on-write, versioning file system for FUSE. CopyFS can
be used to maintain the revision history of a directory containing files
for which you want to track changes, and be able to revert to any older
version. CopyFS lets you do that by transparently making backups of each
file that you modify so that you can review and revert to any previous
revision.

Here is the list of commands related to CopyFS. See their man pages for
additional documentation.

\fIcopyfs-mount\fR(1)

\fIcopyfs-fversion\fR(1)

revert to an older version.
.TP
