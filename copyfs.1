.SH NAME
CopyFS \- Versioning File System for FUSE
.SH DESCRIPTION
CopyFS is a copy-on-write, versioning file system for FUSE. CopyFS can be used to maintain the revision history of a directory containing files for which you want to track changes, and be able to revert to any older version. CopyFS lets you do that by transparently making backups of each file that you modify that you can review and revert to at any point.

Here is the list of commands related to CopyFS. See their man pages for additional documentation.

\fIcopyfs-mount\fR(1)

\fIcopyfs-fversion\fR(1)
